 * Hash table functions:
 *  add      Insert value into hashtable
 *  get      Lookup value into hashtable
 *  hash     Incremental hash function on array of bytes
 *
 * The hash table stores positions within files. The key reflects the contents
 * of the file at that position. This way, we can efficiently find regions
 * that are equal between both files.
 *
 * Hash function on array of bytes:
 *
 * Principle:
 * ----------
 * Input:  a[32]  32 8-bit values (characters)
 *         p      prime number
 * Output: h = (a[31] x 2^31 + a[30] x 2^30 + .. + a[0]) % 2^32 % p
 *
 *
 * Largest n-bit primes: 251, 509, 1021, 2039, 4093, 8191, 16381, 32749, 65521,
 *                       131071 (17 bit), ..., 4294967291 (32 bit)
 *
 * Table entries contain a 32-bit hash value and a file position.
 *
 * The collision strategy tries to create a uniform distributed set of samples
 * over the investigated region, which is either the whole file or the
 * look-ahead region.
 * This is achieved by overwriting the original entry if either
 * - the original entry lies before the investigatd region (the base position), or
 * - a number of subsequent non-overwriting collisions occur where
 *   x = (region size / hashtable size) + 2
 *   --> after x collisions, the collision wins where x is decreasing
 *       as the region mapped by the hashtable grows.
 * as of 23-06-2009 (v0.7)
 * - samples having a high number of equal characters are less meaningless
 *   than samples without equal characters, therefore higher quality samples
 *   win in the collision strategy.
 * - quality is a number between 0 and 3:
 * 		3 = 31 to 24 doubles (equal characters) (lowest quality)
 * 		2 = 23 to 16 doubles (equal characters)
 * 		1 = 15 to 08 doubles (equal characters)
 * 		0 =  7 to  0 doubles (equal characters) (highest quality)
 *
 * Only samples from the original file are stored.
 * Samples from the new file are looked up.
 *
 * The investigated region is either
 * - the whole file when the prescan/backtrace option is used (default)
 * - the look-ahead region otherwise (options -f or -ff)
 *
 * With prescan/backtrace enabled, the algorithm behaves like a kind of
 * copy/insert algorithm (simulated with insert/delete/modify and backtrace
 * instructions). Without prescan/backtrace, the algorithm behaves like an
 * insert/delete algorithm.
